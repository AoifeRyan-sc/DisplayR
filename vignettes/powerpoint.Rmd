These charts are built on top of the mschart and officer packages, which form a portion of the 'officeverse': <https://ardata-fr.github.io/officeverse/index.html>

Our use of this package will mainly be for industrialising the process of exporting R charts to PowerPoint, such that the data is visible inside the presentation. This cuts down the burden on manual work and reduces the likelihood of error when working in Excel/PowerPoint.

Charts in initial automation:

* Volume over time - line chart 
* Grouped volume over time - line chart 
* (Grouped) sentiment distribution - horizontal bar chart

# Creating  Volume Over Time Plots

Let's get some data.

```{r}
df <- DisplayR::disp_example
```

we'll use the `disp_ms_vot` function, which creates a line chart from a data frame. Type `?disp_ms_vot` to access the documentation.

The function counts our date variable for us, and buckets the date variable into day, week, month, quarter, or year, accoding to the input of the time argument.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vot_plot <- df %>%
  disp_ms_vot(date = date, time = "week") 
```

We can preview our plot in a temporary PowerPoint by printing it and setting preview = TRUE

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vot_plot %>%
  print(preview = TRUE)
```

![vot](../man/figures/ms_vot_output.png){width="600" height="400"}

# Creating Grouped Volume Over Time Plots

Usually when creating Volume Over Time charts we want to create a chart which shows the volume for multiple groups, for example we may want to create a sentiment over time chart to show positive, negative and neutral, or the volume over time for each topic in a topic modelling output. Here we should use `disp_ms_vot_grouped`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
grouped_vot_plot <- df %>%
  disp_ms_vot_grouped(date = date, group_var = topic, time = "week") 

grouped_vot_plot %>%
  print(preview = TRUE)
```

![grouped_vot](../man/figures/ms_topics_vot.png){width="600" height="400"}

Now we have a line for each topic, charting its weekly volume. However, the colours are the default colours and may not be what we want to output into PowerPoint.

## Restyling The Plot - Colours

To pass in custom colours we need a named list/vector of colours. We'll use the Viridis palette for demonstrative purposes:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
colours <- viridis::viridis_pal()(9)
topics <- sort(unique(df$topic))
names(colours)  <- topics
print(colours)

grouped_vot_plot <- grouped_vot_plot %>%
  chart_data_stroke(values = colours) #use chart_data_stroke for line charts, chart_data_fill for bar charts.

grouped_vot_plot %>%
  print(preview = TRUE)
```

![topic_viridis](../man/figures/ms_topics_vot_viridis.png){width="600" height="400"}

Now each line has a colour on the viridis scale. We could have used a named vector/list with a different, custom palette - the principle remains the same, we take a named list of values and colours and feed them into the `chart_data_stroke` function. We can make sure the values are correct by extracting them from the data frame, as we did with topics by `topics <- sort(unique(df$topic))`

## Restyling The Plot - Titles

Another likely customisation you'll want to make is to programmatically add titles to your charts. You can use mschart's `chart_labels` function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
grouped_vot_plot <- grouped_vot_plot %>%
  chart_labels(title = "Volume over time plot coloured in Viridis scale", xlab = "Date", ylab = "Weekly volume")
```


# Visualising Sentiment Distributions

We often need to visualise sentiment distributions - either for entire datasets or for groups, or groups within groups...

## Creating Stacked Sentiment Barcharts %

Generally we prefer stacked bar charts to pie charts and their variants. The human visual system is better at comparing lengths and heights than it is areas.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
grouped_sent_chart <- df %>% 
  disp_ms_sent_grouped(sentiment, topic, plot_type = "percent") %>%
  # chart_data_labels(show_val = TRUE)  %>%
  chart_theme(
    grid_major_line_x = fp_border(style = "none"),
    grid_major_line_y = fp_border(style = "none"),
    axis_ticks_y = fp_border(style = "none"))

grouped_sent_chart %>% print(preview = TRUE)
```

### Restyling The Plot - Ordering + Removing Grid Lines

The ordering of our plot is currently alphabetical, which may not be the best way - indeed often is not the best way. A more reasonable ordering may be overall volume. As we have a topic_n variable, we can reorder the topic by topic_n, using `mutate` and `reorder`:

```{r}
grouped_sent_chart <- df %>%
  mutate(topic = reorder(topic, topic_n)) %>%
  disp_ms_sent_grouped(sentiment, topic, plot_type = "percent") %>%
  # chart_data_labels(show_val = TRUE)  %>%
  chart_theme(
    grid_major_line_x = fp_border(style = "none"),
    grid_major_line_y = fp_border(style = "none"),
    axis_ticks_y = fp_border(style = "none"))
grouped_sent_chart %>%
  print(preview = TRUE)
```

Notice that we removed many of the grid lines, this has not been included as defualts within the charting functions presently.

## Creating Stacked Sentiment Barcharts - Volume

Sometimes we may need to create raw volume rather than proportion/%-based charts, we can use the plot_type = "volume" argument to achieve this.

```{r}
grouped_sent_chart <- df %>%
  mutate(topic = reorder(topic, topic_n)) %>%
  disp_ms_sent_grouped(sentiment, topic, plot_type = "volume")
```

### Restyling The Plot - Removing Data Labels

However, we notie that the data labels are now not feasible - some categories have bars which are too small to fit the labels. In this case we can remove with:

```{r}
grouped_sent_chart %>%
  chart_data_labels(show_val = FALSE) %>%
  print(preview = TRUE)
```

## Exporting to PowerPoint

So you've made your plots and now you need to export them efficiently to PowerPoint, this is where the {officer} package shines.

The options for exporting are:

1. Read a current PowerPoint presentation and insert the chart into a new slide.

2. Create a new PowerPoint presentation, insert a new slide, copy the chart into an existing presentation.

1. is nearly always preferable over 2. as for each plot it cuts down on overall steps to go from R --> PowerPoint, and when dealing with 10s, or 100s of plots, the difference is meaningful. 

However, you need to know the path to your PowerPoint presentation,  PowerPoint this can be non-trivial for users not familiar with navigating file systems and directories, especially when working on an interactive/live document, meaning you may need to opt for 2.

### One plot at a time

First we need to initialise a PowerPoint presentation. I have a demo presentation stored at a specific file path, we'll use that one for now. We can store the filepath in a variable and re-use that variable.

```{r}
presentation_path <- "~/Documents/presentations/officer_demo.pptx"
```
